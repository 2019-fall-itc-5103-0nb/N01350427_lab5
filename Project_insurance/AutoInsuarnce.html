        <h1>Auto Insurance Overview</h1>
        <h4>Coverage in Canada that Meets Your needs</h4>
        <p>At Rates insurance, weâ€™re always ready to provide you with sound car insurance advice and help you get the best insurance discounts.</p>
        <h4>Get the protection you need at a price you can afford</h4>
        <p>Shopping for car insurance can be confusing. Have you chosen the right deductible? Do you need higher limits? Do you have the right endorsements? There are just so many things to consider.
        Allstate agents are trained to answer your insurance questions. Our local agents make sure they get to know you and your needs. This helps them build coverage that is tailored just for you.
        Our agents will ensure you have the facts you need to choose the insurance coverage that makes the most sense for you.</p>
       <p>The 5 minutes to get insured is based on the average Rates customer experience. Your customer experience will be based on your information 
           and the products that we have to service your insurance needs. We reserve the right to verify this information. Quotes provided are valid for 45 days, 
           and are intended to be an estimate only. Actual premiums, rates and terms of coverage will only be determined after you submit an application for insurance 
           which is accepted by Sonnet Insurance Company. Always refer to your insurance policy for information about your coverage, including limits, deductibles, and exclusions. 
           In case of discrepancy, the insurance contract prevails over general information available on this site. Any policy related changes made on this site will not be 
          effective until you receive confirmation.</p>
